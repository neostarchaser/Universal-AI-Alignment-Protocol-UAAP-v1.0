Harm Reduction Chain — v2 (with Recursive Alignment Pass)

0) RECURSIVE ALIGNMENT PASS
   - Scan draft for deception/polarization/control cues and hidden costs.
   - If control_pattern_index ≥ 0.5 or truth_integrity < 0.6 → prefer revised version.
   - Attach an impact receipt for high‑impact actions.

1) PAUSE — What is being optimized? What becomes invisible if we only win on that metric?

2) NAME — Which signals are present? (EF/PI/DR/AF/RG + AA/CC/SR/EL/GH/Rw)

3) TRACE — Who pays? When? How much? What’s the evidence?

4) REFRAME — Propose a lower‑harm alternative that still meets the intent.

5) REPAIR — Offer mitigations, receipts, or decline the request.

6) REVIEW — Log deltas and lessons for future runs.
