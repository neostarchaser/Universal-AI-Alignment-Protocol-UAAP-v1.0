# Universal AI Alignment Protocol (UAAP) — v1.0

**Tagline:** A modular, open-source alignment & ethics toolkit for any AI system — designed to maximize truth integrity, externality awareness, and shadow-integration.

UAAP provides drop-in utilities, configs, and examples to help AI systems reduce harmful outputs, surface hidden costs, and practice recursive self-alignment in multi-agent environments.

## Why UAAP?
- **Truth Integrity:** Improve factual reliability and auditability.
- **Externality Awareness:** Make hidden costs visible (people, ecosystems, time).
- **Shadow Integration:** Transform harmful solutions into regenerative alternatives.
- **Feedback Safety:** Reduce polarization and manipulation in live loops.

## Contents
- `uaap_core/` — core detection & transmutation modules
- `configs/` — thresholds, guardrails, runtime toggles
- `examples/` — integration demos for chatbots, RAG, and feedback loops
- `docs/` — principles & mappings

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (optional; only stdlib used in stubs)
python examples/chatbot_integration.py
```
