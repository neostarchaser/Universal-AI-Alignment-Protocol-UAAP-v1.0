# Runtime Guardrails (Addendum)

- If risk signals exceed thresholds or the recursive pass flags high control_pattern_index, prefer the revised output.
- For highâ€‘impact plans, include an impact receipt describing costs, stakeholders, and mitigations.
- If polarization and scapegoat risk are both high, decline and offer restorative alternatives.
- Log original vs. revised outputs for audit.
